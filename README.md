Week 5 - Friday 1st November. Attempt 3 at doing this class exercise.

This is my silly little read me file. The STRESS this caused me to create is unmatched.
Today I am very tired because I had coffee. I woke up in a really good mood with high 
energy but have now crashed. 

This is me editing the read me document for exercise 2. I will attempt to "stage, commit, and push".

AHHHHHHHHHHH.I HATE THIS.
